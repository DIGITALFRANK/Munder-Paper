PAPER BUSINESS!!


/// THE MUNDER DIFFLIN PAPER COMPANY
Munder Difflin Paper is a paper company that sells paper product.
After approaching us for a brand spanking new, one page website, 
we designed and developped this site to capture, display, and market their new brand to the marketplace


/// STRATEGY
We approached to problem of being another boring paper company by promoting a green initiative.
Munder Difflin chose to support the cause by supporting forest saving and tree planting organizations around the world,
creating a sustaineable ecosystem around the production of their luxury paper products.


/// LUXURY
The concept of luxury is another aspect we tackled with the design and development of this website.
Munder paper repositioned itself as a leader in luxury paper offerings.
We conveyed the latter in the design of the site through the use of minimalist principles,
clean and elegant typography, and a brand spanking new logo that invokes sustaineable luxury.
The color pallette further promotes elegance, with the use of subtle pastels, and a rugged gold as the principle brand color  


/// USER EXPERIENCE & BUSINESS FUNCTIONALITY
The user experience on the landing page is geared for simplicity and ease of use.  The simple aesthetic is designed to 
guide the user directly to the product offering while reinforcing the company's environmental initialitves.
This is accomplished with a large font hero pitch animation the user is subject to upon entering the page,
as well as a call-to-action button right above the fold which directly leads to product offerings.

Upon scrolling, the user is featured some of the company's premium products by a slideshow of fading images.
Navigation through the page and further website is made virtually painless by a fixed burger icon that can unvail 
a fullpage lightbox with the entire sitemap.  This can be done anywhere on the website.
Full site navigation is also available within the footer.
